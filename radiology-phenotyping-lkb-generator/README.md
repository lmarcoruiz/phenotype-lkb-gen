This set of scripts is created to design a Linked knowledge base that uses SNOMED-CT as a spine.
Some connect to the UMLS server automatically to retrieve mappings used to create logic OWL EL axioms that map equivalences among terms and attach them to the SNOMED-CT RDF(S) spine ontology.
Some scripts define OWL axioms to link radiology reports containing free text processed with NLP and linked to the LKB to enable phenotyping queries.
The SNOMED-CT files are not provided due to licensing restrictions. They can be accessed in the SNOMED-CT Spanish edition site for thos that have a SNOMED-CT license in place.
